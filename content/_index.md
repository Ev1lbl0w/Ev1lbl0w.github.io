I'm Ricardo Subtil, also known as `ev1lbl0w`. Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a passionate developer, mostly interested in the area of game design and engine development, but I also have a keen interest in many more areas, such as low-level programming, eletronics, VR development, etc... I am always curious and eager to try out new ideas and/or projects.

- Check out my personal [projects](/projects) and open-source contributions!
- I write [blog posts](/posts) from time to time.

My social profiles and contacts are available at the bottom of this website *(CV included)*.
