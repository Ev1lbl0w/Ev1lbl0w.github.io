> *You have chosen, or been chosen, to investigate one of my finest remaining urban repositories. I thought so much of GitHub that I elected to establish my website here, with the CI so thoughtfully provided by our benefactors. I have been proud to call Github my host. And so, whether you are here to stay, or passing through on your way to projects unknown, welcome. It's safer here.*

This is the source code of my website at [rsubtil.github.io](https://rsubtil.github.io/).

Feel free to use both code and contents however you see fit. If you have any suggestions or problems to report, please open an issue.
